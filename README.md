# Learning From Arabic Corpora But Not  Always  From Arabic  Speakers: A Case Study of the Arabic Wikipedia Editions

In this repository, we contribute the scripts and data we used to analyze Arabic Wikipedia editions: Modern Standard Arabic, Egyptian Arabic, and Moroccan Arabic, comparing them to the English Wikipedia using Wikimedia Statistics ([Wikistats](https://stats.wikimedia.org/#/all-projects)) API. 

<!-- The results of this analysis have been used  in our **accepted** paper "***Learning From Arabic Corpora But Not Always From Arabic Speakers: A Case Study of the Arabic Wikipedia Editions***" in [the Seventh Arabic Natural Language Processing Workshop (WANLP 2022)](https://sites.google.com/view/wanlp2022/), EMNLP 2022, Abu Dhabi, UAE (Dec 8th, 2022). -->

    abstract = "Wikipedia is a common source of training data for Natural Language Processing (NLP) research, especially as a source for corpora in languages other than English. However, for many downstream NLP tasks, it is important to understand the degree to which these corpora reflect representative contributions of native speakers. In particular, many entries in a given language may be translated from other languages or produced through other automated mechanisms. Language models built using corpora like Wikipedia can embed history, culture, bias, stereotypes, politics, and more, but it is important to understand whose views are actually being represented. In this paper, we present a case study focusing specifically on differences among the Arabic Wikipedia editions (Modern Standard Arabic, Egyptian, and Moroccan). In particular, we document issues in the Egyptian Arabic Wikipedia with automatic creation/generation and translation of content pages from English without human supervision. These issues could substantially affect the performance and accuracy of Large Language Models (LLMs) trained from these corpora, producing models that lack the cultural richness and meaningful representation of native speakers. Fortunately, the metadata maintained by Wikipedia provides visibility into these issues, but unfortunately, this is not the case for all corpora used to train LLMs.",
